# TextCNN

TextCNN (Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Classification) is a type of neural network architecture used for text classification tasks. It is inspired by the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) commonly used in image processing tasks, but it is adapted for processing text inputs.

The TextCNN model takes a sequence of words as input, represented as a matrix of word embeddings. The model then applies a series of convolutional filters over the input, with each filter spanning a fixed number of adjacent words. The convolutional operation generates a feature map, which is then processed by a max-pooling layer that extracts the most important features. The output of the pooling layer is then fed into a fully connected layer for classification.

The convolutional filters used in TextCNN can capture local patterns in the input text, such as n-grams and other word combinations. The max-pooling layer helps to extract the most salient features from the feature maps generated by the convolutional layer. The fully connected layer at the end of the network learns to map the extracted features to the appropriate class label.

TextCNN is a simple and effective model for text classification tasks, and it has been used successfully in a variety of natural language processing applications, such as sentiment analysis, topic classification, and spam detection.
